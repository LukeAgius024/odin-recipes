        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; spray foil with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Arrange chicken thighs, skin-side up, on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Combine garlic salt, onion salt, oregano, thyme, paprika, and pepper in a small bowl; mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle spice mixture liberally over chicken thighs.</li>
            <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until skin is crispy, thighs are no longer pink at the bone, and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
